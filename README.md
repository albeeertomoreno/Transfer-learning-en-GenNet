# Transfer-learning-en-GenNet
This repository is a brief summary of my master's thesis 'Predicting Alzheimer's disease conversion in Mild Cognitive Impairment patients: A transfer learning approach with explainable AI'.  It is not the whole work but a part of it that may be useful for future research that my thesis director may carry out.
